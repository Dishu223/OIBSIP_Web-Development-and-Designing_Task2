Cinematic Tribute Page: Eren Yeager
A visually immersive, single-page website dedicated to the character of Eren Yeager. 
This project moves beyond a standard tribute page to tell a story through a "cinematic timeline," using advanced CSS techniques like 
parallax scrolling and scroll-based animations to create a dynamic and engaging narrative experience.

Objective
The primary goal was to create a tribute page that was as dramatic and compelling as its subject matter. 
Instead of a static layout, the objective was to build a modern, animated, and visually stunning single-page experience that showcases advanced front-end design skills, particularly in CSS.

Steps Performed
Concept Design: A "Cinematic Timeline" concept was developed to guide the user through the key stages of the character's life. The design uses a dark, moody color palette and epic typography to match the tone of the series.

Parallax Scrolling: Full-screen background images were used for the hero section and as "chapter breaks" between timeline sections.
The background-attachment: fixed; CSS property was used to create a parallax effect, where the background images move at a different speed than the foreground content, creating a powerful sense of depth.

Animated Vertical Timeline:

The main content was structured as an alternating vertical timeline, with event cards appearing on either side of a central line.

The AOS (Animate On Scroll) JavaScript library was implemented to trigger subtle fade and slide animations on the timeline cards as the user scrolls them into view.

Video Integration: For the final, climactic section, an auto-playing, looping background video was embedded to create a highly dynamic and impactful moment.

Hero Section Fade Effect: Custom JavaScript was written to create a smooth fade-out effect for the entire hero section as the user begins to scroll down, creating a seamless transition into the main timeline content.

Tools Used
HTML5: For the semantic structure of the page, including <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>.

CSS3:

Flexbox: For centering content within sections.

Parallax Effect (background-attachment): To create the immersive scrolling experience.

Advanced Layout: For building the custom alternating vertical timeline.

JavaScript (ES6+):

AOS (Animate On Scroll) Library: To easily implement scroll-triggered animations.

Scroll Event Listeners: To create the custom fade effect for the hero section.

Outcome
The result is a highly polished and visually engaging tribute page that effectively uses modern web technologies to tell a story. This project demonstrates a strong ability to think beyond standard layouts and use advanced CSS and subtle JavaScript to create a memorable user experience. It serves as an excellent showcase of front-end design and animation skills.
